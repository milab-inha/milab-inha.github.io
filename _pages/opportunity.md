Thank you for your interest in our research at Inha University. 

To understand the current projects in my group, please refer to our in-press papers and recent conference papers. It's essential to recognize that every member of my group possesses unique qualities, and I collaborate with each one to identify projects that align with their interests.

If you are interested in doing research with us, [send me an email(mailto:hklim@inha.ac.kr) with your CV and/or transcript].
