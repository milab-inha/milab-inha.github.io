Thank you for your interest in the research at MI Lab. 

To understand the current projects in MI Lab, please refer to our recent journal and conference <a href='https://milab-inha.github.io/publications'>papers</a>. However, every member of my group is unique and I work with each person to find projects that suit their interests.

If you are interested in doing research with us, [send me an email(mailto:hklim@inha.ac.kr) with your CV and/or transcript].
