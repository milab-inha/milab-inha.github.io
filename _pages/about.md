Welcome to to the website of Machine Intelligence (MI) Lab @ Inha Univ. 

At the MI Lab, we delve into the intersection of computer vision, image processing, and inverse problems, with a particular focus on deep generative models.

Research Focus:

* Deep Generative Model
* Computer Vision 
* Image Processing
* Inverse Problem

We are looking for highly motivated students and postdocs with a strong interest in the area of machine learning. If you are interested, please read  <a href='https://milab-inha.github.io/prospective'>this instruction</a> and contact me.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder. 

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
